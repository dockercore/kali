NBTscan version 1.5.1. Copyright (C) 1999-2003 Alla Bezroutchko.
This is a free software and it comes with absolutely no warranty.
You can use, distribute and modify it under terms of GNU GPL.

Usage:
nbtscan [-v] [-d] [-e] [-l] [-t timeout] [-b bandwidth] [-r] [-q] [-s separator] [-m retransmits] (-f filename)|(<scan_range>) 
	-v		verbose output. Print all names received
			from each host
	-d		dump packets. Print whole packet contents.
	-e		Format output in /etc/hosts format.
	-l		Format output in lmhosts format.
			Cannot be used with -v, -s or -h options.
	-t timeout	wait timeout milliseconds for response.
			Default 1000.
	-b bandwidth	Output throttling. Slow down output
			so that it uses no more that bandwidth bps.
			Useful on slow links, so that ougoing queries
			don't get dropped.
	-r		use local port 137 for scans. Win95 boxes
			respond to this only.
			You need to be root to use this option on Unix.
	-q		Suppress banners and error messages,
	-s separator	Script-friendly output. Don't print
			column and record headers, separate fields with separator.
	-h		Print human-readable names for services.
			Can only be used with -v option.
	-m retransmits	Number of retransmits. Default 0.
	-f filename	Take IP addresses to scan from file filename.
			-f - makes nbtscan take IP addresses from stdin.
	<scan_range>	what to scan. Can either be single IP
			like 192.168.1.1 or
			range of addresses in one of two forms: 
			xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx/xx or xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx-xxx.
Examples:
	nbtscan -r 192.168.1.0/24
		Scans the whole C-class network.
	nbtscan 192.168.1.25-137
		Scans a range from 192.168.1.25 to 192.168.1.137
	nbtscan -v -s : 192.168.1.0/24
		Scans C-class network. Prints results in script-friendly
		format using colon as field separator.
		Produces output like that:
		192.168.0.1:NT_SERVER:00U
		192.168.0.1:MY_DOMAIN:00G
		192.168.0.1:ADMINISTRATOR:03U
		192.168.0.2:OTHER_BOX:00U
		...
	nbtscan -f iplist
		Scans IP addresses specified in file iplist.
